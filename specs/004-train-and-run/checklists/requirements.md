# Specification Quality Checklist: Train Model & Bring Up Stack

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- Validation result: all items pass on first iteration. The spec deliberately keeps
  serving-path internals out of scope (operational/procedural feature) and states the
  0.85 precision gate as a non-negotiable outcome (SC-002, FR-009/FR-010).
- Tool/product proper nouns (Python version, GPU class, GitHub, Docker) appear only in
  Assumptions as environment facts, not as prescribed implementation choices in the
  requirements or success criteria.
